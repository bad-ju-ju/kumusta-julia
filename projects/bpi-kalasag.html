            <h2 class="fade-in">The Problem</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
                4 million Filipino seniors face a growing "confidence gap" in digital banking. As financial services
                move online, elderly users are increasingly left behind — vulnerable to fraud, overwhelmed by complex
                interfaces, and disconnected from the protection they deserve.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in">
                This isn't just a usability problem. It's a trust problem, a safety problem, and ultimately, a dignity
                problem.
            </p>

            <div class="divider fade-in"></div>

            <h2 class="fade-in">The Approach</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Over 6 rigorous weeks, I led a multidisciplinary team through research, ideation, prototyping, and
                presentation — wearing the hats of Team Leader, Product Manager, Researcher, and Developer
                simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in">We designed BPI Kalasag around three pillars:</p>
            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li><strong>Radically Simple UI</strong> — Stripped-down interfaces with large text, clear iconography,
                    and guided flows designed specifically for senior cognition patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Guardian System</strong> — Family members receive real-time alerts and can
                    co-manage accounts, bridging the trust gap between seniors and digital banking</li>
                <li><strong>Proactive AI Defense</strong> — Intelligent transaction flagging that catches suspicious
                    activity before it becomes fraud, protecting seniors without requiring tech literacy</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="divider fade-in"></div>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Impact & Results</h2>
            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li>Secured <strong>2nd Place</strong> in the BPI Data Wave Hackathon's Hyper-Personalization track</li>
                <li>Addressed the confidence gap for <strong>4 million seniors</strong> with a comprehensive solution
                </li>
                <li>Demonstrated cross-functional leadership — research, design, engineering, and strategy — in a
                    high-stakes competitive environment</li>
                <li>Validated the approach with judges from BPI's leadership team</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="divider fade-in"></div>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Reflection</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Kalasag means "shield" in Filipino. That's what this project was about — not just building software, but
                building protection. The most meaningful insight from this experience was that inclusive design isn't
                about simplifying for the "less capable." It's about recognizing that the system was never designed for
                them in the first place — and choosing to change that.
