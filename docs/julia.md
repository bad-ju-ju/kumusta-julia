As requested, I am sharing the details of my UX design background and hackathon achievements to provide more context on my technical leadership and user-centric approach.

1. BPI Data Wave Hackathon (Hyper-Personalization Track) – 2nd Place
This was a rigorous 6-week initiative where I served as the Team Leader, Product Manager, Researcher, and Developer.

Project: BPI Kalasag – A proactive digital shield designed for senior financial wellness.

Key Impact: We addressed the "confidence gap" for 4 million seniors by designing a Radically Simple UI, a Collaborative Guardian system for family alerts, and Proactive AI Defense to flag suspicious transactions.

2. FlutterFlow HackFest: Impact Challenge
For this 24-hour high-intensity hackathon, I served as the Team Leader and Product/Project Manager for team Likha.

Core Focus: Rapidly prototyping high-impact digital solutions at the Google Philippines headquarters.

Technical Skill: Leveraged low-code/no-code proficiency to accelerate the Product Development Life Cycle (PDLC).

3. UX Design & Technical Prototyping
My design philosophy is grounded in data and technical feasibility.

Certifications: I hold Google Professional Certificates in Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design and Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, and Ideate.

Usability Testing: In my current role, I led initial usability testing for the SIGE.eat platform with non-technical participants, achieving a 100% positive response rate.

Design Workflow: I utilize AI-driven tools like Stitch for wireframing and frequently code the prototype myself (JS/HTML/CSS) to ensure a seamless transition to live code.
